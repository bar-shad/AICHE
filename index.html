            <h2>American Institute of Chemical Engineers</h2>
            <p>We are the Michigan State University Student Chapter of the 
            American Institute of Chemical Engineers. As a student professional 
            organization, we have a responsibility to serve our members, our institution, 
            our community, and our sponsors. We hold biweekly general and board meetings 
            and provide opportunities for the Chemical Engineering student body to interact with 
            each other and with industry. We promote and foster the academic and professional growth of 
            MSU Chemical Engineers through the structure of meetings, luncheons, and other events</p>

            <h3>CHEM-E-Car</h3>
            <p>Chem-E Car is an AICHE-sponsored competition that increases awareness of the chemical engineering discipline among the public, industry leaders, educators, and other students. A team of chemical engineering students
                must design a car that runs and stops on chemical reactions. Michigan State's team competes nationally against other universities.
                Chem-E car provides an opportunity to boost resumes and compete in a design project while making friends
                along the way. The current car design uses wet cell batteries as a power source. The stopping mechanism
                is a sodium thiosulfate clock reaction. No experience is necessary. Everyone has to start somewhere.</p>

            <h3>CHIP</h3>
            <p>AIChE is also excited and proud to sponsor a new student group. 
                The Chemical Engineering Introductory Program (ChIP) was founded this past 2021-2022 school year. 
                ChIP aims to help undergraduate students bridge the gap between the chemical engineering curriculum and real-world problems. 
                The club gives students hands-on application to what they learn in the classroom, leadership opportunities, 
                and a space to foster relationships with fellow students within their major.
                 Throughout the course of the school year, the student group will work on a project. 
                 Last year’s project was designing and building a functional coffee maker that was compatible with Keurig Cups. 
                 While ChIP was started by chemical engineering undergraduates, the student organization is open to students from any major. 
                 It is great to see AIChE members taking an initiative to provide a social and educational environment outside the classroom for their peers.

        <h1>Symposium Day</h1>
        <p>our chapter organizes an event unique to Michigan State University - the Annual CHEMS Symposium Day. Symposium day consists of a morning full of breakout sessions that examine technical and professional topics in chemical engineering hosted by research representatives from various companies. These events are followed by a keynote speaker in the afternoon and offer students an opportunity in the spring to interact with companies. Questions about Symposium Day can be directed to this year’s Symposium Day Committee Chairs listed below. We also offer Upperclassman Panels for a Q & A session with a selection of juniors/seniors, graduate students, and recently graduated students that have accepted full-time offers. These panels have high success among underclassmen and provide those students with insight on making decisions about their future. MSU AIChE has an interest in beginning a few new professional development events including speed networking and resume reviews. We would love for your company to help bring these ideas to life!
